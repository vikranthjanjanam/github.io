## Projects

### AI Image Generator

- Developed a Generator Adversarial Network using a Dimensional Noise Vector to add random noise to the augmented images from the training data set created from the videos provided by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation.
- Resultant discriminator GAN enhanced the real-time live detection and location of the Starfish.

### Drive Safety Alerts

- Coined an Android app for drive safety alerts through GCP Firebase service using Scientific Geodesics and GIS on GPS data to avoid high-speed vehicular accidents.
- Integrated app in university commute and designed live monitoring portal through gMaps API.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

- Performed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering on a Kaggle dataset with 2 million entries to detect credit card fraud transactions using neural networks in PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Inherited SMOTE-EEN algorithm on the imbalanced dataset to enhance the performance of minority class, with 89% accuracy.

### Soil Moisture Monitoring

- Configured and administrated Soil Moisture monitoring system on AWS IoT core using Raspberry Pi Zero through Capacitive Moisture Sensor and created an SNS service to stream alerts upon moisture drop below the threshold.
